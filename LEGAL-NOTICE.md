# Legal & Rehosting Policy

We respect upstream licenses:

- **Splunk BOTSv3 (CC0):** mirroring is permitted, but we link to Splunk’s S3 and verify their published hash. If an offline mirror is required, we keep the canonical link and MD5 in our manifest.
- **LANL Unified Host & Network (CC0):** same policy—link first, mirror only if needed for offline use.
- **Security‑Datasets (MIT) & Export‑WinEvents (BSD‑3):** we link and preserve notices; redistribution allowed with attribution.
- **Mordor (GPL‑3.0) & LOLBAS (GPL‑3.0):** we avoid mirroring by default; if necessary, we redistribute under the same license with full attribution.

This repository includes only tiny samples for parser smoke tests. All substantial datasets remain at their original locations.
