### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin using the VectorForge LotL Data Pack:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/VectorForgeAI/vectorforge-threat-telemetry.git](https://github.com/VectorForgeAI/vectorforge-threat-telemetry.git)
    cd vectorforge-threat-telemetry
    ```
2.  **Review the Documentation**
    Read the [Overview in our docs](docs/00-overview.md) to understand the core concepts and data schemas.

3.  **Choose Your Path**
    Select the delivery path (Option A, B, or C) that best fits your needs and follow the detailed instructions in its respective guide.

### Prerequisites

Before using the automation scripts, please ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (Required for Option A)
- Git

### Three Paths to Telemetry

We offer three distinct paths to acquire the data you need:

* **Option A ‚Äî Download-only:** The fastest path to get started. Seed your environment with trusted public datasets that already contain a rich mix of Windows and Sysmon events.
* **Option B ‚Äî Generation-only:** The highest-fidelity approach. Generate LotL telemetry within your own lab environment, using your gold images and security configurations.
* **Option C ‚Äî Hybrid:** The recommended approach for most teams. Combine the speed of public datasets with the realism of targeted, lab-generated events.

### Use Cases

This project is designed for:
- **Detection Engineers:** Validate and test new detection rules for your SIEM or EDR.
- **Security Researchers:** Analyze adversary tradecraft using realistic event logs.
- **SOC Analysts & Threat Hunters:** Train with high-quality data to recognize subtle signs of LotL activity.
